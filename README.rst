Kolibri server installer source for Debian
=================================================

This package automates the configuration of a proper web server setup to use Kolibri in intensive traffic scenarios.

It configures and starts nginx & uwsgi daemons to work together with Kolibri,
so caching of static assets is done and use of multicore architecture most servers have is activated when possible.
